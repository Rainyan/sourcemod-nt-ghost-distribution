## Generating the dataset

- Compile the VMFs from mapsrc & place the corresponding BSP files in the server's maps folder
- Changelevel to one of the BSPs you want to test
- Add 2 bots to the server with `bot_add` (requires `sv_cheats 1`), so the ghost will spawn
- Set the `NUM_GHOST_SPAWN_POINTS` preprocessor constant to the number matching that map
- Recompile and place the plugin in the server's SourceMod plugins path
- Reload the plugin if it doesn't auto-activate
- Wait until tests completion (progress shown in the server's console output)
- The generated dataset will be written in the server's `NeotokyoSource` root folder
- Move the dataset to this relative path's dataset folder

## Generating the images
